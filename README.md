## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-management-system.git
cd inventory-management-system
```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

```

*If `requirements.txt` is not present, install commonly used packages:*

```bash
pip install pillow tkcalendar
```

4. **Database**

The application uses **SQLite** by default and will create `inventory.db` automatically on first run. If you prefer MySQL, update the DB configuration in `database.py` and install the appropriate connector (e.g. `mysql-connector-python`).

5. **Run the application**

```bash
python main.py
# or
python inventory_system.py
```

Open the application window and log in with a valid employee ID (or create an initial employee through the DB if needed).

## 🚀 Usage (quick walkthrough)

* **Login**: Enter Employee ID and password to access the system.
* **Dashboard**: Overview tiles show total employees, suppliers, categories, products, and total sales.
* **Employee / Supplier / Category / Product**: Use the left-side menu to open modules. Perform Add / Update / Delete and Search.
* **Sales**: Add customer details, select products, update quantities, apply discount, and generate printable bill files.
* **View Bills**: Open saved `.txt`/.pdf files from the bill history panel to review or print.

## 📊 Highlights & Benefits

* Friendly GUI that reduces manual paperwork for small shops
* End-to-end workflow: inventory → cart → bill generation
* Easily portable — runs on any machine with Python and Tkinter
* Configurable to use a server-based SQL DB if multi-user access is required
